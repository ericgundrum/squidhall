# Tutorial: Creating and Testing Content Module Files

Content module files are the way we specify what website content is hosted in the Virtual Squid Hall and where that content is located in the 3D space. Content module files consist of JSON data formatted according to the [Module File Specification](modulefile-specification.md) to the [SquidSpace Module File requirements](squidspace-modulefiles.md). See also, 'Annotated Example Content Module File' and 'Full Example Content Module File' below for detailed examples.

When you are ready to continue, read on to 'Tutorial Steps' below.

### What this tutorial covers

This tutorial will take you step by step through the process of creating and testing a content module file for art panels or tables using framed art. After the tutorial steps there are some more detailed descriptions of certain content file values, followed by a template module file, an annotated module file, and a full example of a module file.

When you finish this tutorial you should understand the basics of content module files and how to use the SquidSpace tools to manage the asset pipeline, generate Javascript modules and test/debug a content module file.

### What this tutorial does not cover

This tutorial does not cover placing objects on tables or plinths, although in the extra information below there are some more detail and examples of how to do this. 

NOTE: When placing objects the 3D object files need to be converted to .bablyon format by hand. For more on this see [How To Convert .obj Files to .babylon files](how-to-convertobjtobabylon.md)

Separately, you may be required to use Git for version control, which adds the following steps:

1. Cloning the Git repo

2. Creating a branch and modifying it

3. Committing your changes and pushing the branch to the Git repo

4. Making a 'Pull Request' for your branch

These things are important to the process and, even if you are not required to do them, someone will be. 

However, using Git – or other methods of putting the content files you create onto the production server – falls outside the purview of this tutorial.

## Tutorial Steps

The process of creating a content module file requires you to determine which images you want to include from the website. You can create one content module file per web page or you can combine content from multiple web pages into a single content module file. For this tutorial we are going to create a content module for a single web page in nine steps.

Start with Step 1 below.

### Step 1. Create a new content module file

Create a new file using a plain text editor. Do not use a WYSIWYG word processor unless you know how to change and save the file as plain text. 

Copy and paste the JSON text in 'Content Module Template' below. Then save the file using a name appropriate to the web page you are working on with a 'triple' extension of 'content.module.json'. For this tutorial we are going to save the file as 'ai-weiwei.content.module.json'.

Change the 'MODULE-NAME' value in the template to a unique name appropriate for the module that will be generated. For this tutorial we are going to use 'aiweiwei'.

Continue with Step 2 below.

### Step 2. Open a web page with a gallery

Navigate your web browser to the content page you want to use. In this tutorial we are going to use this page on the test site: https://squid.fanac.com/art-show/ai-weiwei/

When the page comes up you will see the image gallery and some information about the artist. We are going to use that information to fill out the content module file.

Continue with Step 3 below.

### Step 3. Determine which images you will use

You may already have a list of images to use, supplied by the artist or someone else. If not you should look at the gallery and decide which images are appropriate. In any case you also need to consider how many images you can fit onto an art panel or a table. Generally you can place no more than four or five images on an art panel or a table without sizing them too small for easy visibility. Also, overall, the fewer total images the better because we have a goal of minimal system requirements to view the 3D space and every image uses memory and CPU resources at runtime.

For this tutorial we are going to use the first two images in the gallery, plus the fifth image; for a total of three.

Continue with Step 4 below.

### Step 4. Create resource declarations for each image or object

In the template file there is a "resources" section that contains "objects" and "textures" sections. In the "textures" section there is a texture resource declaration template. We are going to use three images for our resources, so copy that template and paste it two more times for a total of three. Make sure to remove the comma after the last texture resource declaration so the JSON parser doesn't have a fit.

For each image change the 'RESOURCE-NAME' and 'FILE-NAME' values to something unique and appropriate. For this tutorial are going to use 'ai-weiwei-1', 'ai-weiwei-2', and 'ai-weiwei-3'. 

Change the 'IMAGE-URL' to the URL of each image you are going to use. How you get the URL is dependent on the browser you are using; for Firefox I bring up the full-size image in the gallery by clicking on the image and then I right-click on the picture and choose 'Copy Image Location' from the popup menu.

While you are at it you will want to make note of the image dimensions, because you will be using them later in step 5. There are many different ways to get this value, but generally if you 'save as' the image you can open it in a image editing program and it should provide a way to get 'image information' that includes the dimensions. 

See 'Annotated Example Content Module' below for more detail on what each of these JSON elements does and what the expected values are.

When you are done your "textures" section should look like this:

	"textures": [
		{
			"resource-name": "ai-weiwei-1",
			"config": {
				"cache-options": {
					"url-source": "https://squid.fanac.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IP_0815_-053-scaled.jpg",
					"filter-profile": "ArtJpg"
				},
				"pack-options": {
					"action": "link"
				},
				"file-name": "ai-weiwei-1.png"
			}
		},
		{
			"resource-name": "ai-weiwei-2",
			"config": {
				"cache-options": {
					"url-source": "https://squid.fanac.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IP_0815_-059-scaled.jpg",
					"filter-profile": "ArtJpg"
				},
				"pack-options": {
					"action": "link"
				},
				"file-name": "ai-weiwei-2.png"
			}
		},
		{
			"resource-name": "ai-weiwei-3",
			"config": {
				"cache-options": {
					"url-source": "https://squid.fanac.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IP_0815_-062-scaled.jpg",
					"filter-profile": "ArtJpg"
				},
				"pack-options": {
					"action": "link"
				},
				"file-name": "ai-weiwei-3.png"
			}
		}
	]

If you are doing a table layout continue with Step 5.b below. (You can do both if you want.)

### Step 5.a. Create an Art Panel Layout

In the template file there is a "layouts" section that contains a 'layout area declaration'. In the layout area there is a 'data' section containing two 'object placement declaration' templates; one for an art panel layout and one for a table layout. We are going to use art panel layout, so you can delete the other one unless you are going to do that step too. Make sure to remove the comma after the last object placement so the JSON parser doesn't have a fit.

#### Modify the Layout Area Name

Each layout area specifies a named area of the 3D space and a 'data' section. The data section contains one to many 'object placement declarations' for objects placed within the named layout area. See 'Layouts, Object Placers, and Object Names' below for more detail. 

Change the 'LAYOUT-AREA-NAME' value to the layout area containing the art panel you will be using. All the layout areas you will be using are pre-defined in the 'furniture.module.json' file. For this tutorial we will be using 'artshow'.

#### Modify the Object Placement Declaration

Each object placement declaration specifies an object and contains a 'data' section. The data section contains one to many 'object placer declarations' for specific placements of copies of the object or for objects placed 'on' the object. In this case we are placing 'framed art images' on an art panel.

Change the 'ART-PANEL-NAME' value to the fully-qualified name of the art panel you will be placing the images on. All the art panels you will be using are pre-defined in the 'furniture.module.json' file. However, the 'fully qualified name' of an already-placed object, such as our art panel, is dependent on the object placer used in the layout. See 'Layouts, Object Placers, and Object Names' below for more detail. 

For this tutorial we will use 'artshow.artpnl-1-ew-1-0' for the 'ART-PANEL-NAME'. In the 'furniture.module.json' file it is specified in the 'artshow' layout area as 'artpnl-1-ew-1' using an object placer that creates a row of objects and adds a number and a dash to the object name for each one. See also 'Using the squidhalltest.html Debugging Features' below for a way you can easily find out the name of any object in the 3D space or find any object in the 3D space by name. 

#### Modify the Object Placer Declaration

Each object placer declaration specifies a 'place name' to use for that placement and contains 'options' and 'data' sections specifying how the placement is done. The place name value may be used for the name of a placed object or, if the placement results in multiple copies of an object, it is the 'root' of each placed object's name. See 'Layouts, Object Placers, and Object Names' below for more detail. 

Change the 'PLACE-NAME' value to a unique name within the layout area. For this tutorial we will use 'ai-weiwei'.

The 'options' section specifies the placer algorithm to use. In this case we are using one named 'ArtPlacer', which creates frames for specified images and locates them on the object specified in the object placement declaration above. 

The 'ArtPlacer' algorithm allows an optional 'moreInfoData' subsection of the 'options' section for information about the placed images. For the 'moreInfoData' values you want to pull the relevant information from the web page. Change 'INFO-TITLE' to a title for a popup dialogue, 'INFO-LINK-TEXT' to the text of an HTML link, 'INFO-URL' to the URL the text links to, and 'INFO-DESCRIPTION' to a more detailed description. For this tutorial we are using the following: 

* "title": "Ai Weiwei",

* "link-text": "Ai Weiwei's Page",

* "link": "https://squid.fanac.com/art-show/ai-weiwei/",

* "text": "Ai Weiwei is a Chinese contemporary artist, active in sculpture, installation, architecture, curating, photography, film, and social, political and cultural. These photos are from an exhibit held of his work on Alcatraz island in the former prison buildings in 2015."

The 'data' section lets you specify which texture resources to use and whether they are placed on the front or the back of the art panel.

Change the 'FRONT-OR-BACK' value to 'front' if you want it on the front of the art panel or 'back' if you want it on the back. For this tutorial we will use 'front'.

The 'textures' subsection of the 'data' section contains one to many 'texture placement specifications'. Since we are placing three images, copy and paste the template texture placement specification two times for a total of three. Make sure to remove the comma after the last texture placement specification so the JSON parser doesn't have a fit.

For each image change the 'RESOURCE-NAME' to one of the 'RESOURCE-NAME' values specified in step 4. The 'WIDTH' and 'HEIGHT' values specify the size and shape of the frame used for the image. What size you use is up to you, except for two considerations:

* We want the size values to reflect the proportions of the original image, which we took note of in Step 4

* The sizes are specified in 3D space units; which are approximately 1 meter per unit (the art panels are 1 unit high and 0.6 units wide)

The same applies to the 'POS-X' and 'POS-Y' position values. Moreover, the position is specified as left to right ('POS-X') and top to bottom ('POS-Y') on the art panel starting from the upper left corner of the chosen side of the panel. 

See 'ArtPlacer, TablePlacer and PlinthPlacer Algorithms' below for more detail on size and position units and how X/Y positioning works.

For this tutorial we are going to use some appropriate values, keeping the size of each image frame less than half as wide as the panel and staggering them a bit. 

See 'Annotated Example Content Module' below for more detail on what each of these JSON elements does and what the expected values are.

When you are done your layouts section should look like this:

	"layouts": [
		{
			"layout-name": "artshow",
			"data": [
				{
					"object": "artshow.artpnl-1-ew-1-0",
					"data": [
						{
							"place-name": "ai-weiwei",
							"options": {
								"placer": "ArtPlacer",
								"moreInfoData": {
									"title": "Ai Weiwei",
									"link-text": "Ai Weiwei's Page",
									"link": "https://squid.fanac.com/art-show/ai-weiwei/",
									"text": "Ai Weiwei is a Chinese contemporary artist, …"
								}
							},
							"data": {
								"textures": [
									{
										"texture": "Ai-Weiwei-1",
										"doc": "Size is WxH.",
										"size": [0.6, 0.45],
										"position": [0, 0]
									},
									{
										"texture": "Ai-Weiwei-2",
										"size": [0.6, 0.8],
										"position": [0.5, 0.6]
									},
									{
										"texture": "Ai-Weiwei-3",
										"size": [0.6, 0.45],
										"position": [0.2, 1.5]
									}
								],
								"place-on": "front"
							}
						}
					]
				}
			]
		}

Continue with Step 6 below.

### Step 5.b. Create a Table Layout

In the template file there is a "layouts" section that contains a 'layout area declaration'. In the layout area there is a 'data' section containing two 'object placement declaration' templates; one for an art panel layout and one for a table layout. We are going to use table layout, so you can delete the other one unless you are going to do that step too. Make sure to remove the comma after the last object placement so the JSON parser doesn't have a fit.

#### Modify the Layout Area Name

Each layout area specifies a named area of the 3D space and a 'data' section. The data section contains one to many 'object placement declarations' for objects placed within the named layout area. See 'Layouts, Object Placers, and Object Names' below for more detail. 

Change the 'LAYOUT-AREA-NAME' value to the layout area containing the table you will be using. All the layout areas you will be using are pre-defined in the 'furniture.module.json' file. For this tutorial we will be using 'artshow'.

#### Modify the Object Placement Declaration

Each object placement declaration specifies an object and contains a 'data' section. The data section contains one to many 'object placer declarations' for specific placements of copies of the object or for objects placed 'on' the object. In this case we are placing 'framed art images' on a table.

Change the 'TABLE-NAME' value to the fully-qualified name of the table you will be placing the images on. All the tables you will be using are pre-defined in the 'furniture.module.json' file. However, the 'fully qualified name' of an already-placed object, such as our table, is dependent on the object placer used in the layout. See 'Layouts, Object Placers, and Object Names' below for more detail. 

For this tutorial we will use 'artshow.ArtShowDesk-1-0' for the 'TABLE-NAME'. In the 'furniture.module.json' file it is specified in the 'artshow' layout area as 'ArtShowDesk-1' using an object placer that creates a row of objects and adds a number and a dash to the object name for each one. See also 'Using the squidhalltest.html Debugging Features' below for a way you can easily find out the name of any object in the 3D space or find any object in the 3D space by name. 

#### Modify the Object Placer Declaration

Each object placer declaration specifies a 'place name' to use for that placement and contains 'options' and 'data' sections specifying how the placement is done. The place name value may be used for the name of a placed object or, if the placement results in multiple copies of an object, it is the 'root' of each placed object's name. See 'Layouts, Object Placers, and Object Names' below for more detail. 

Change the 'PLACE-NAME' value to a unique name within the layout area. For this tutorial we will use 'ai-weiwei-tbl'.

The 'options' section specifies the placer algorithm to use. In this case we are using one named 'TablePlacer', which creates frames for specified images and locates them on the object specified in the object placement declaration above. 

The 'TablePlacer' algorithm allows an optional 'moreInfoData' subsection of the 'options' section for information about the placed images. For the 'moreInfoData' values you want to pull the relevant information from the web page. Change 'INFO-TITLE' to a title for a popup dialogue, 'INFO-LINK-TEXT' to the text of an HTML link, 'INFO-URL' to the URL the text links to, and 'INFO-DESCRIPTION' to a more detailed description. For this tutorial we are using the following: 

* "title": "Ai Weiwei",

* "link-text": "Ai Weiwei's Page",

* "link": "https://squid.fanac.com/art-show/ai-weiwei/",

* "text": "Ai Weiwei is a Chinese contemporary artist, active in sculpture, installation, architecture, curating, photography, film, and social, political and cultural. These photos are from an exhibit held of his work on Alcatraz island in the former prison buildings in 2015."

The 'data' section lets you specify which texture resources to use and what the 'origin corner' for the table is. 

Change the 'ORIGIN-CORNER' value to one of 'nw', 'ne', 'sw', or 'se' to specify which corner of the table is the 'back-left' for purposes of placing image frames on the table. For this tutorial we will use 'nw'. See 'Layouts, Object Placers, and Object Names' below for more detail on the origin corner.

The 'textures' subsection of the 'data' section contains one to many 'texture placement specifications'. Since we are placing three images, copy and paste the template texture placement specification two times for a total of three. Make sure to remove the comma after the last texture placement specification so the JSON parser doesn't have a fit.

For each image change the 'RESOURCE-NAME' to one of the 'RESOURCE-NAME' values specified in step 4. The 'WIDTH' and 'HEIGHT' values specify the size and shape of the frame used for the image. What size you use is up to you, except for two considerations:

* We want the size values to reflect the proportions of the original image, which we took note of in Step 4

* The sizes are specified in 3D space units; which are approximately 1 meter per unit (the tables are 0.9 units long and 0.375 units deep)

The same applies to the 'POS-X' and 'POS-Y' position values. Moreover, the position is specified as left to right ('POS-X') and top to bottom ('POS-Y') on the art panel starting from the upper left corner of the chosen side of the panel. 

See 'ArtPlacer, TablePlacer and PlinthPlacer Algorithms' below for more detail on size and position units and how X/Y positioning works.

For this tutorial we are going to use some appropriate values, keeping the size of each image frame less than half as wide as the panel and staggering them a bit. 

See 'Annotated Example Content Module' below for more detail on what each of these JSON elements does and what the expected values are.

When you are done your layouts section should look like this:

	"layouts": [
		{
			"layout-name": "artshow",
			"data": [
				{
					"object": "artshow.artpnl-1-ew-1-0",
					"data": [
						{
							"object": "artshow.ArtShowDesk-1-0",
							"data": [
								{
									"place-name": "ai-weiwei-tbl",
									"options": {
										"placer": "TablePlacer",
										"moreInfoData": {
										"title": "Ai Weiwei",
										"link-text": "Ai Weiwei's Page",
										"link": "https://squid.fanac.com/art-show/ai-weiwei/",
										"text": "Ai Weiwei is a Chinese contemporary artist, …"
										}
									},
									"data": {
										"textures": [
											{
												"texture": "Ai-Weiwei-1",
												"size": [0.3, 0.225],
												"position": [0, 0]
											},
											{
												"texture": "Ai-Weiwei-2",
												"size": [0.3, 0.4],
												"position": [0.4, 0]
											},
											{
												"texture": "Ai-Weiwei-3",
												"size": [0.3, 0.225],
												"position": [0.9, 0.3]
											},
											{
												"texture": "kathryn-duval-1",
												"size": [0.3, 0.225],
												"position": [1.3, 0.15]
											}
										],
										"origin-corner": "nw"
									}
								}
							]
						}
					]
				}
			]
		}

Continue with Step 6 below.

### Step 6. Validate the JSON

It's important that the JSON you create is properly formed. If it is invalid in some way the SquidSpace tools will fail to load it with an ugly-looking JSON parsing error, which might not be overly helpful in pinpointing exactly where you went wrong. 

Your text editor may validate the JSON as you enter it. If not and the text editor doesn't support some other form of JSON validation you will want to use an external validator. There are several on the Internet; you can search for one and use it by copying the JSON text in your text editor and pasting it into the validator page. 

Note that these kinds of validators can only verify the JSON is properly formed. If you do not include information the SquidSpace tools are expecting to see you may get an entirely different kind of error. For this reason it is important to make sure you start from the template below and follow the instructions exactly.

When you are sure your JSON is correct, continue with Step 7 below.

### Step 7. Run the Asset Pipeline

NOTE: This step may have system requirements. See 'Using the SquidSpace Tools' below.

For this tutorial we will run the asset pipeline locally and verify the pipeline can fetch and convert the images as specified in the content module file. 

To run the asset pipeline enter the following line in a terminal session from the working directory:

	python3 tools/sqs/sqs.py pipeline ai-weiwei.content.module.json

If the command fails because the content module file is incorrect in some way you will see one or more error messages. You may need to return to one of the previous steps of the tutorial and work forward again from there.

Otherwise you will need to verify everything worked. To do this, look in the 'textures/content' directory. There should be three files named 'ai-weiwei-1.png', 'ai-weiwei-2.png', and 'ai-weiwei-3.png'.

When you are sure the asset pipeline has run correctly, continue with Step 8 below.

### Step 8. Generate the Javascript Module

NOTE: This step may have system requirements. See 'Using the SquidSpace Tools' below.

For this tutorial we will run the code generator locally and verify the generator can create a valid module file. 

To run the code generator enter the following line in a terminal session from the working directory:

	python3 tools/sqs/sqs.py generate ai-weiwei.content.module.json

If the command fails because the content module file is incorrect in some way you will see one or more error messages. You may need to return to one of the previous steps of the tutorial and work forward again from there.

Otherwise, combine your generated content module with all the other content modules:

	python3 tools/sqs/sqs.py pipeline content/*.content.module.json

Now you will need to verify everything worked. To do this, look in the 'libs/modules' directory. There should be a Javascript module named 'content.js'. At a minimum there should also be 'world.js' and 'furniture.js' files as well. If they do not exist you will need to generate them from the 'world.module.json' and 'furniture.content.json' module files.

When you are sure all required module are generated, continue with Step 9 below.

### Step 9. Test and Debug in the 3D Space

NOTE: This step may have system requirements. See 'Using the SquidSpace Tools' below.

For this tutorial we will run a local web server and visually verify the results using the squidhalltest.html page. 

To run the web server enter the following line in a terminal session from the working directory:

	python3 tools/sqs/sqs.py serve

Once the web server is running, start a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/squidhalltest.html

The test page should load and present you with a view of the 3D space. It might take a while before all the assets are loaded and you can navigate around. If it fails to load take a look at the web browser console and see if there are any clues to why in the debug and error messages there. 

You should be able to 'walk up' to the art panel or table you used in the tutorial and visually verify the expected image are sized and positioned as you expected them. If the images are not there at all take a look at the web browser console and see if there are any clues to why in the debug and error messages there. 

If you found a problem that requires correction, go back to one of the previous steps. If everything looks good, you have completed the tutorial and can read below for more detail on how things work.

## Layouts, Object Placers, and Object Names

The [Module File Specification](modulefile-specification.md) and the [SquidSpace Module File requirements](squidspace-modulefiles.md) documents detail how layouts work, with the latter document providing considerable information on the object placer declarations. However, neither document specifies how object placer algorithms *work*.

Put simply, an object placer is a function that is called with information from a module file, creates one or more 3D object instances (sometimes cloned from existing objects) and puts them in specific places in the 3D space. This object placer function is registered with SquidSpace with a name, but is not necessarily provided by SquidSpace and may be a custom implementation. For example, ArtPlacer, TablePlacer and PlinthPlacer placer algorithms are specific to the Squid Hall project and even contain hard-coded expectations about the objects they are placing art frames on. Other placer algorithms, such as 'LinearSeries' are SquidSpace 'builtins'.

Basically, while processing layouts SquidSpace calls the function registered with the placer name in the object placer declaration, passing the options and data values from the declaration along with other context, such as the layout area and the object specified in the object placer declaration. The placer function can perform this placement any way it likes and, moreover, can place as many 3D objects as it likes. 

It is not required, but the placer function can also register the 3D objects it creates and places with SquidSpace using a unique name that only refers to that one 3d object within the space. These names must adhere to the following rules:

* The name must be namespaced by the layout area using dot notation; for example, a 3D object registered with the 'place name' 'foo' in layout area 'bar' has the name 'foo.bar'

* If the placer function creates multiple copies of a 3D object and registers them, it must extend the 'place name' with a dash and a unique number for each instance; for example, three 3D objects with the 'place name' 'foo' in layout area 'bar' will have the names 'foo.bar-0', 'foo.bar-1', and 'foo.bar-3'

This naming scheme allows us to specify particular objects placed by the SquidSpace layout engine in a separate module file, so long as the placer function registers the object. If the placed 3D object will never need to be referred to later it is not necessary. 

## List of Placer Algorithms

Every module files user 'placer algorithms' to put things into the space. Below is a list of all the available placer algorithms, although in actual practice for content you will mostly be using the ArtPlacer, TablePlacer and PlinthPlacer algorithms.

Basic placer algorithms (mostly used for placing furniture):

* Single - Places a single item at a specified position in the space

* LinearSeries - Places a series of items in a row in the space, you can specify the direction the row goes and the number of items in the series

* RectangleSeries - Places a series of items in a rectangle

Squid hall-specific placer algorithms for furniture and world items (most require code changes to modify where things are placed):

* LightPlacer - Puts lights in a predetermined position in the hall

* BeamPlacer - Puts the beams in predetermined position in the hall ceiling

* BannerPlacer - Puts the beams in predetermined position in the hall ceiling

* CurtainPlacer - Puts the curtains in predetermined position around the hall

* SquidPlacer - Puts the squid on the back of the hall

* SignFullPlacer - Puts the large signs in predetermined positions around the hall

* SignHalfPlacer - Puts the smaller signs in predetermined positions around the hall

Squid hall-specific content placer algorithms for placing art and object content onto furniture (do not require code changes to use):

* ArtPlacer - Places images on art panels

* TablePlacer - Places images and objects on tables

* PlinthPlacer - Places objects on plinths

## ArtPlacer, TablePlacer and PlinthPlacer Algorithms

The ArtPlacer, TablePlacer and PlinthPlacer placer algorithms are very similar, but each is optimized for placing image frames or objects on a specific 3D object type: ArtPlacer knows about art panels and image frames and places frames right to left and top to bottom. TablePlacer knows about tables and places frames or 3D objects right to left and back to front. PlinthPlacer knows about plinths and can place one 3D object on a plinth.

For ArtPlacer and TablePlacer algorithms the frame size is specified as Width x Height (W/H). The size should retain the proportions of the original image for best results. In general a width of 0.5 or less and a proportional height work best.

For ArtPlacer and TablePlacer algorithms the frame position is specified as X x Y (X/Y) using a 2D coordinate system to place the fames on the target 3D object. With the ArtPlacer the coordinates are vertical and the 0/0 point is the upper left corner. With the TablePlacer the coordinates are horizontal and the 0/0 point is a specified corner of the table. 

Note that sizes and positions are specified in 3D space units; which are approximately 1 meter per unit. The art panels are 1 unit high and 0.6 units wide. The tables are 0.9 units long and 0.375 units deep.

With the ArtPlacer you specify placing the frames on the 'front' or the 'back', where the front is generally towards the north end of the space on non-rotated panels and towards the west end of the space on rotated panels.

With the TablePlacer you specify a corner of the table to use as the 'origin'. (The 0/0 position.) The 'origin corner' value must be one of 'nw', 'ne', 'sw', or 'se' to specify which corner of the table is the 'back-left' for purposes of placing image frames on the table.

![Origin corner of a table, with layout](img/tableex1.png)

Note that the user spawns in the NW corner of Squid Hall facing SE. So 'north' is the end of the hall with the art show and the history area and 'south' is the end of the hall with the squid. 

This means for each table you must determine where the 'back' and 'front' of the table is in relation to how the table is placed/rotated in the space and how it would be approached by users; then determine the best origin corner from that. Generally if a table is not rotated and you approach it from the north, the origin corner should be 'se'; whereas if you approach it from the south the origin corner should be 'ne'. A rotated table works the same, but for east approaches you want 'sw' and for west approaches you want 'ne'.

![Origin corners of dealer table square](img/tableex2.png)

With the PlinthPlacer algorithm you can only specify the object rotation and scaling, since there is only one 3D object per plinth.

NOTE: When placing objects the 3D object files need to be converted to .bablyon format by hand. For more on this see [How To Convert .obj Files to .babylon files](how-to-convertobjtobabylon.md)

## Using the SquidSpace Tools

The SquidSpace tools are written using Python version 3 and have only been tested on Unix systems. (Linux and macOS.) They may work with Windows and other operating systems, but it is not guaranteed. 

Other than Python3 the SquidSpace tools have *no external requirements or dependencies*. However, the 'ArtJpg' filter profile specified in the 'world.module.json' file has a dependency on the ImageMagick image conversion command line utility. (ImageMagick is executed via the system shell.) For this reason you cannot execute any tool functions requiring the 'ArtJpg' filter, such as asset pipeline management, unless ImageMagick is properly installed on your system.

In some cases you may need to perform the steps of this tutorial 'blind' and submit the resulting content module file to someone else to perform Steps 7 and 8. After which they can supply you with the results or the URL of the test page on a server so you can do Step 9.

For more information, see [How To Manage Content for Squid Hall](how-to-content-management.md) and the [SquidSpace.js Tools Reference](squidspace-tools.md).

## Using the squidhalltest.html Debugging Features

The 'squidhalltest.html' page is a special test version of the Virtual Squid Hall with the following features not found in the 'squidhall.html' page:

* Extra debugging log output
   - If you open your browser console log after loading squidhalltest (how you do this is browser-dependent) you will see a *lot* of log messages not shown by the regular squidhall page; these are often quite useful in determining what went wrong
   
* Debug control panel that lets you toggle special functionality
   - 'Fly' turns off gravity and lets you fly around the space; very useful for getting a bird's eye of object placements
   - 'Show Inspector' pops up a pair of object inspector panels provided by Babylon.js; mostly useful only for 3D artists
   - 'Find and Identify Objects' lets you click on an object to identify it or find an object by double-clicking the object name in a list
   
To open the debug control panel simply click the 'hamburger' icon next to the FPS (Frames Per Second) label on the toolbar.

![The debug control panel](img/debugpnl.png)

When you enable 'Find and Identify Objects', two things happen:

1. Any object properly registered with SquidSpace can be clicked on to identify it
   - When clicked a label will appear with the fully qualified 3D object name, it's position, and it's rotation
   - More detail will be printed out to the console log, including the 3D object size, which you can refer to later
   - Clicking on a different object makes the label go away for the first object and a new label appear for that object

2. A list of every registered object is added to the debug control panel
   - If you double click on a 3D object name in the list a label will appear over that object in the space

![The debug control panel with 'find' enabled](img/debugpnlsrch.png)

There are some limitations for how the label works when 'finding' a 3D object via the list, most due to limitations in Babylon.js. If you have no idea where in the space an object is, the best way to find it is to turn on 'fly' mode and get above everything looking down, then double click on the object name.

## Content Module Template

This is a template for creating new content module files. The values in upper-case need to be replaced with actual values. Note that elements inside of JSON array sections (the areas surrounded by square brackets, '[]') or object sections (the areas surrounded by curly brackets, '{}') must be separated by commas *except for the last element*. The most common mistakes made when copying and pasting JSON elements is forgetting to add a comma to middle elements or forgetting to remove the comma on the last element.

This template includes object resources and object placements (for tables or plinths), which are not included in the tutorial steps above. Please remove them when following the tutorial; however, when using this template for real content modules involving tables with objects or plinths you will need to retain them.

For a detailed explanation of what each JSON element means, see 'Annotated Example Content Module' below. For a complete example of a content module see 'Full Example Content Module File' below.
